This repository has two folders

  1. codingtest (Contains the problem sets)
  2. coverage (Results of code coverage as Html files)

### Prerequisites:
------------------
  Install maven
  `sudo apt install maven`

   After you install check for maven version and machine specs. Here is my system specs. The program should run seamlessly if the user has similar specs as mine

  `mvn --version`



 `Apache Maven 3.3.9`  
 `Maven home: /usr/share/maven`    
 `Java version: 1.8.0_131, vendor: Oracle Corporation`     
 `Java home: /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre`    
 `Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8`

  `git clone https://github.com/karthikBalasubramanian/the_weather_company.git`

  As you download from your command prompt, you will see a new folder called "the_weather_company" under your present working directory.

### Package Structure

2. `src/test/java/codingtest` - contains the unit test classes for the program logic.



### Build

  `mvn package`

  you should get a build output like this for a successful build.

  ![build2](./outputs/mvn_build2.png "build_part_2")

### Coverage
------------------

[ECL Emma](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/) is the code coverage tool that is used to get code coverage reports. Use [installation  instructions](http://www.eclemma.org/installation.html#marketplace) to download this eclipse plug-in.


got to **coverage** folder and click **index.html** and navigate  via hyper links to check code coverage of specific classes.
